# DirExplorer

This is a test project for the Software Developer position.
The task is to create a Swing application with the following features:

- Browse the structure and contents of directories on the local disk and inside ZIP archives
- Show a preview of files in the selected directory (at least text files and images should be supported)
- Filter files in the directory by a specified extension

Implementation details:

- All details of the user interface are left to candidate's discretion
- The program should be written in Java or Kotlin and work on various operating systems
- The task evaluates not only the quality of the code, but also the convenience and functionality of the UI

## Running the application

AFAIK - just open the project in IDEA and run

## Implemented functions

Either run the application (then opens in the home directory), or open the desired directory from command line.
