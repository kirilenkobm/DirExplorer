# TODO list

* Hotkeys
* Mouseover hints
* Entity select on one click, open on two
* ~~Thumbnails - ImageIO supported formats are enough~~
* Thumbnails - optimise performance, macOS Finder manages it better
* ~~Thumbnails - do not redraw what already drawn~~ - added cache
* Settings - auto update
* Cyrillic languages
* PDF previews
* BUG: if open an image with many figures, and jump to another directory until all are loaded - the view still tries to draw all the figures, only after then the view jumps to another directory.
* ~~Adaptive number of columns - not the best solution tho~~
* ~~Cache getContents() result~~
  * but compatible with zip archives
* If image previews are not loaded -> allow to skip loading and jump to another dir
